### 0.2.0

_Released 2022 Oct 17_

#### Improvements

- Improved error messages across the board.
- Improved reliability of Java version inference.
  - The inference now uses the `compileJava` task's properties instead of the
    project-wide toolchain.
  - The inferred Java version can now be overwritten and additional versions can
    be added using the `javaVersion` and `javaVersions` functions.

#### Fixes

- Fixed a bug that prevented the plugin from automatically deriving the
  Minecraft dependency from the ForgeGradle plugin (if available).
- Fixed a bug that could cause Gradle to issue confusing warnings.
