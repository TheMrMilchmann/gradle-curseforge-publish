### 0.7.0

_Released 2024 Nov 28_

#### Improvements

- Added `@DslMarker` annotations to the public configuration DSL to prevent
  accidental usage of functions from outer scopes.
- Implemented a new `from(any: Any)` function to flexibly parse changelog
  contents from char sequences or file sources.
  - This function was erroneously mentioned in the documentation already.
- Support inferring metadata from [ModDevGradle](https://github.com/neoforged/ModDevGradle).
  - The Minecraft version and mod loader is now automatically set when the
    ModDevGradle plugin is detected.

#### Breaking Changes

- As a result of the added `@DslMarker`, the public configuration DSL is now
  stricter and may require changes to existing build scripts.
- Updated the minimum required Gradle version to 8.0 (from 7.6).
- Updated the minimum required Java version to 17 (from 8).
