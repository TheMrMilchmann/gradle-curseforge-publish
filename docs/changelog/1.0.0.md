### 1.0.0

_Not Released Yet_

#### Improvements

- Added `@DslMarker` annotations to the public configuration DSL to prevent
  accidental usage of functions from outer scopes.

#### Breaking Changes

- As a result of the added `@DslMarker`, the public configuration DSL is now
  stricter and may require changes to existing build scripts.
- Updated the minimum required Gradle version to 8.0 (from 7.6).
